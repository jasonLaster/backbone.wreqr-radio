Backbone.Channel
================

[Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr) expands upon Backbone's event capabilities by implementing three distinct message patterns collectively referred to as `Wreqr`.

`Backbone.Channel` expands upon this by providing a simple means to organize multiple `Wreqr` instances on a single object into what's called a Channel.
